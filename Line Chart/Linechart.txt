# **Line Chart**

1. A line chart is a type of chart that displays information as a series of data points
connected by straight line segments.

2. Sometimes multiple graphs can depict the same information. Here, a connected scatter plot is
created where the data is sorted based on the horsepower, to get meaningful insights from the line chart.

3. You can notice that two line charts with the same axes are plotted, unlike the box plot where
subplots created multiple boxes. To do this, the axis object, returned from the subplots( )
method is passed to both the line charts using the 'ax' parameter. Note that the number of
rows and columns have not been passed to the subplots method.

4. The plot method takes care of the colours to make each line look distinct.
Also, 'linestyle' parameter can be passed to display the lines in different styles.

5. It can be observed that as horsepower increases the mileage is likely to decrease.
It can also be deduced that there is a peak in mileage at around 100 horsepower,
which was not so clear in the scatter plot created previously.

6. In the 'CarsData' dataset, it is required to observe the variations in 'MPG.city', 'Engine Size',
'MPG.highway' and 'RPM' against 'Horsepower'. The line chart can be used for this purpose to aptly show the fluctuations.

7. The 'plot' method in 'matplotlib.pyplot' creates a line chart. It takes two parameters x values and y values, both numerical in nature.

- Notice that RPM has been divided by 100 to maintain the scale of the graph because of its high values.

8. It can be observed that horsepower does not have a major impact on engine size. On the other hand, it unpredictably affects RPM.
The effects of high horsepower remain the same on mileage. Although mileage of a car in a city is affected a little more than its mileage on a highway.

9. A line chart can also be created vertically, by inverting the previous line chart 90 degrees to the right.
To do so 'x' and 'y' in the 'plot' method can just be interchanged as shown fig3:
