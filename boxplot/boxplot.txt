# **Box Plot**
1. The price range of the cars can be represented using a box plot. It is a graphical way of depicting
the five-number summary as discussed in the Introduction to Probability and Statistics course.

2. Matplotlib works efficiently with dataframes and arrays. So, Pandas DataFrame can be used as they
have some functionality of matplotlib built-in to create visualisations. You will notice that the
same method is followed thought-out this module.

3. The Python code to create a box plot for the price range of cars using cars_df["Price"] column.

4. plot( ) is a method of the DataFrame that takes a parameter 'kind' for displaying the appropriate
visualisation. For example, the word 'box' is used to generate a box plot. Similarly, other visualisations
are generated if values like bar, line, scatter, etc. are used as the 'kind' parameter.

5. The skewness of data can also be identified from the visualisation of a box plot.
Since the box in the ScreenShot of plot is towards the minimum, this data is right-skewed.
Similarly, if the data is left-skewed, then the box would be towards the maximum.

- Mathematically:

- Outliers < Q1 - 1.5 (IQR)

- Outliers > Q3 + 1.5 (IQR)

6. It can be observed that, if the outliers are excluded, then:

- minimum price of a car comes close to 10 thousand dollars and maximum price comes close to 40 thousand dollars

- most cars are priced approximately between 11 thousand dollars to 22 thousand dollars

# **Box Plot Using Sub Plots**

1. Let us use the subplots functionality of 'matplotlib.pyplot' to create a grid-like system based on the
number of rows and columns provided, as shown in the code after box plot:

2. The subplots method returns a figure object and axes objects and their functionality is as follows:

- Figure object: It controls the structure of the plot as shown above, where the height and width of the plot needs to be set.

- Axes object: It controls what exists in the plot like labels, data, text etc.

3. The number of axes objects depend on the number of elements in that grid. For example, if there are two elements,
there will be two axes objects.

4. Let us use the axes objects to create boxplots alongside each other for the range of horsepower and mileage of cars, as shown in the code:

# **Multiple Box Plots with Same Axes**

1. Another way to create a box plot is by using the 'grid' method. Let us modify the code in the previous page by
using the 'sharey' and 'sharex' properties of the subplots.

2. The different types of cars along with their prices can now be easily compared. Many other things can also be infered from the above visualisation.
For example, vans have the smallest price range, whereas midsize cars have the largest price range
small cars have the lowest price, whereas large cars have the highest price

# **Multiple Box Plots in Smae Canvas**

Until now all plots in the subplot were plotted individually, due to which they could not be compared.
Therefore, let us try to plot box plots of different types of cars in one plot so that all these plots
are plotted in the same canvas and are comparable.
