# **Scatter Plot**

1. Now that you know the individual ranges of both horsepower and mileage,
let us find if there is any relationship between them. Plotting these values
against each other might reveal the presence of a relationship among them.

2. Since the scatter plot is a 2D plot, the x and y are passed in the same
order as shown in the above code. The parameters 'color' and 'marker' can be
used to adjust the colour and shape of the points shown in the plot.

- For example, black asterisks are used for displaying each data point.

3. Here, it can be observed that as horsepower increases the mileage is likely to decrease.

# **Scatter Plot Based on a Category**

1. The unique values of the car type in the previous plots. The same list is used to create
a scatter plot between horsepower and mileage.

2. From the scatter plot it can be understood that higher the horsepower, lower the milage
of a car in a city. It can also be deduced that vans give the least mileage in a city whereas
small cars are the best fit though they have the least horsepower.
