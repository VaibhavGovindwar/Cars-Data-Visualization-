# **Pie Chart**

- Assume, there is a need to find the number of cars based on the number of cylinders they contain.

- First, let us see the unique number of cylinders a car contains.

# For graphical representation, let us create a pie chart

- Let us analyse the code to understand the pie chart shown below, as follows:

1. The data is grouped on 'Cylinders' and 'Type' using the groupby() method.

2. The pie() method returns patches, texts, and autotexts. Patches control individual slices of the
pie chart. Refer to the documentation to know more about the return values.


3. The output of the code is the pie chart shown below, which clearly depicts the distribution of number
of cylinders of different types of cars.
