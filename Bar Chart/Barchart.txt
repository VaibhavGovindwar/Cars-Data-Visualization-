# **Bar Chart**

1.  Box plot, scatter plot, or line chart fail when there is a need to plot both categorical a
nd numerical data, as they can only take numerical data. Then, how to find relationships between
such types of data? Which graph can be used?

2. The answer to the questions above is a bar chart or a bar graph. A bar chart takes in two features,
'x' and 'y' as inputs. 'x' is the categorical data  plotted against 'y' which is the numerical data.
The following code shows a simple bar chart between 'DriveTrain' and 'MPG.city' along with the plot aesthetics.

# **Horizontal Bar Chart**

3. A bar chart can also be plotted horizontally using the barh() method from 'matplotlib'.

# **Stacked Bar Chart**

1. Consider the type of data with multiple categories. Assue, there is a need to plot a graph using
different colours representing each category.

- Let us consider 'Passengers' and 'Type' from the 'CarsData' dataset.

2. Matplotlib has built-in colormaps. Here, 'Paired' is used.
Refer to 'matplotlib.cm' documentation for more colormap options.

- Note: The three methods in the above code, size(), unstack() and reset_index() have been utilized
for demonstration purposes and are required only on a case to case basis.

# ** Error Bar Chart**

1. Error bars on a cartesian graph are a graphical enhancement to visualise the variability
of plotted data. They are used on graphs to indicate the uncertainty in a reported measurement.
A general idea of how precise a measurement is, can be obtained by using error bar charts.

2. Error bars can be added to the plot using 'yerr' or 'xerr' feature of bar() and barh() methods.
They are used to plot the standard deviation, maximum-minimum or confidence intervals in a dataset.
In the code, the standard deviation is plotted. Observe that a different colormap called 'seismic' has been used.

3. The output of the graph. The black lines parallel to one of the axes are the error bars.
This graph is interpreted by the length of the error bar. Longer the bar, more the deviation and
shorter line indicates less deviation from the data.

# ** Grouped Bar Chart**

1. Let us discuss the grouped bar chart where the bars are stacked beside each other to show the
difference between multiple features used on 'x' to the values of 'y'.

Assume, there is a need to see how each type of 'DriveTrain' performs based on 'MPG.city', 'MPG.highway' and 'RPM'.

First, let us see the unique values in 'DriveTrain'.

2. Now, let us plot the bar chart using the code

3. The bar chart is plotted with the first argument 'x' which can be manipulated to set the
position of the bar on the x-axis. Height or 'y' of the bar is the value from the 'grouped_cars' dataframe.

4. In bar plots, the 'xticks' of the bar must be assigned. If not specified, their values would be
equal to the values assigned to 'ind' variable, shown in the code above. To position the 'xticks'
at the center for each of the three grouped bars, 'i+width' is used.
