# **Histogram**

1. A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of numerical data.
In a histogram, the height of the bar represents the frequency in the class interval for that dataset.

Assume, there is a need to plot the range of mileage under which most cars fall.

The output of the code is a histogram, as shown below, from which it can be inferred that
most cars have a mileage between 15 and 20.

2. To get more specific information, the class interval of the data can be changed using the 'bins' parameter.
Let us increase the number of bins from 6 to 20, as shown in the code:

The output of the code is a histogram, as shown below,
from which it can be inferred that most cars have a mileage in the range of 16 to 18, if we consider
the range to be in intervals of two.

3. The above graph is difficult to read because of the values on the x-axis. To address this issue,
custom values can be set using the xticks() method.

The colour of a histogram can be changed using the 'color' parameter. It is a built-in feature of
matplotlib and can take values between C(0-9). The code implements the above requirements as shown below:

4. A probability density plot can be created by making a histogram smooth and continuous using an
estimation function. It can be useful in visualising 'shape' of the data as a continuous replacement
for a discrete histogram.

note: -------import scipy-----
5. The 'kind = density' parameter plots the density line of the data. The 'density = True'
parameter returns the probability densities of each bar of the histogram. And, the xlim( ) method
is used to set the limit of the axis between 14 and 50, as shown in the code:

6. The most common estimation function is the 'kernel density estimation' technique that
lets you create a smooth curve over a given set of data, as shown in the plot below:
